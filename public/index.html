                    The history of ping pong dates back to the 1880s when it evolved from lawn tennis as an indoor 
                    alternative. Originally called "whiff-whaff," the game quickly gained popularity in England and 
                    spread throughout Europe and Asia. Today, table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis 
                    Federation (ITTF) and is played in over 220 countries and territories.
